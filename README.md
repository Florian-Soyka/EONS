# EONS
Evaluation of Non-Sinusoidal Magnetic Fields

In order to create an MLAPP file that the MATLAB AppDesigner can read, you have to put the contents of the src\ folder in a zip file and name it EONS.mlapp.

The Logo.gif file and the EONS_parameters.txt must be in the MATLAB working directory when you run EONS from within the AppDesigner. 

The path for Reilly's SENN program has to be specified in the parameters file. It can be downloaded here:

A non-sinusoidal sample waveform is provided in the waveforms\ folder. It was recorded during welding using phase cutting.
